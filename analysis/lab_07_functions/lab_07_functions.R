# Lab 06 - Distributions, Simulation, Basic Functions

# Objectives:
# 1) simulate data:
# - 50 students in the class
# - 3 exams
# - There is 5% chance that a student will fail to show up to any given exam (independent)
# - Exam 1 has the mean of 80, Exam 2 has the mean of 70, Exam 3 has the mean of 60
# - Each exam has a standard deviation of 10

# 2) compose a function that puts each exam on the scale from 0 to 1

# 3) compose a function that graphs the distribution of a single exam with ggplot2
# --- clean-environment ------
